# From Software Engineer to AI Builder: A Practical Kickstart 🚀

### Why this article?
If you’re a software engineer and curious about AI, you’ve probably felt lost in jargon: **LLMs, RAG, Agents, Tools, Memory, MCP…**

This guide will demystify those terms and show you how to write a tiny **Proof of Concept (POC)** (C# is used for demonstration).  
We’ll walk through a real healthcare example — *“I have diabetes and swelling in my toes. What should I do?”* — and see how AI pipelines and agentic AI handle it differently.  

By the end, you’ll know how to:
- Understand what happens when a prompt flows through AI components  
- See why agentic approaches matter and their benefits  
- Follow a step-by-step healthcare use case  
- Know what components are needed to build an AI system  
- Understand the role of models vs frameworks  
- Write a tiny POC (both hard-coded pipeline & agentic approaches)

## 1️⃣ What happens when you prompt an AI? 🕵️‍♂️

**Patient’s prompt:**  
👉 “I have diabetes and swelling in my toes. What should I do?”

Here’s the chain of events:  

- **Frontend (UI)** — Collects text input and sends it to the backend.  
- **Backend Orchestration Service** — The conductor; routes the request.  
- **Memory** — Pulls past facts (e.g., patient has diabetes for 10 years).  
- **Embeddings + Vector DB** —  
  - Convert prompt → embedding (vector).  
  - Query vector DB for similar entries (e.g., diabetic-foot guidelines).  
  - Return relevant knowledge chunks.  
- **LLM (Large Language Model)** — Takes prompt + context, generates text or tool requests.  
- **Tools** — Backend-defined functions (e.g., `get_clinical_guidelines`, `get_patient_history`).  
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — The “air-traffic controller” for your AI system.  
  It manages **service discovery, context sharing, and coordination** between LLMs, tools, and memory.  
  It tells the model what tools are available, how to call them safely, and how to access external context such as user data or organizational policies.  
- **Backend** — Combines everything into final output.  
- **Frontend** — Displays safe, summarized advice.

## 2️⃣ Pipeline vs Agentic — Why Agentic Matters 🤔

Imagine you’re training a new nurse.  

- With a **pipeline**, you give them a *script*:  
  - *If the patient has diabetes and their foot is swollen → look up this guideline.*  
  - *If the patient has chest pain → run this test.*  
  - *If the patient has a fever → give this medicine.*  

  This works fine … until the patient asks something you didn’t write in the script. Then the nurse is stuck.  

- With **agentic AI**, instead of a script, you give the nurse a *toolbox*:  
  - They can check medical guidelines, pull lab results, or call a specialist — depending on what the patient says.  
  They’re not following a rigid script; they’re *choosing the right tool in real time.*  

👉 **Why does this matter?**  
Real patients don’t follow scripts. Agentic AI adapts to unexpected inputs without thousands of hard-coded rules.  

💡 **Quick thought experiment:**  
How long would it take to write “if/then” rules for 100 symptoms? Weeks. That’s why agentic AI is the practical choice.

## 3️⃣ Healthcare Example in Action 🏥

**Prompt:**  
👉 “I have diabetes and swelling in my toes. What should I do?”  

When this request flows through the system:  

- **LLM Call** → For a simple general question, the model may answer from its pre-trained knowledge: *“Toe swelling in diabetes could be serious — consult a doctor.”*  
- **RAG (Vector DB)** → Embeddings are compared to a guideline KB (e.g., ADA guidelines on diabetic-foot complications).  
- **Tools (APIs)** → Backend may call domain systems:  
  - **EMR Tool:** `get_recent_lab_reports(patientId)` → returns latest HbA1c, glucose.  
  - **Drug Interaction Tool:** checks whether meds (metformin, insulin) may be related.  
- **Memory** → Patient-specific info (“Diabetes for 10 years,” “reported numbness last month”) personalizes risk assessment.  
- **Final Orchestration (Backend)** → Merge guideline + labs + history + LLM reasoning → deliver safe, contextual recommendation.  

So the same prompt can trigger **LLM**, **RAG**, **Tools**, and **Memory** — each playing a distinct role.  

### 🧩 Who decides what happens?  

- In a **pipeline-based** system, your **backend orchestration service** decides what to do using hard-coded logic — for example:  
  *“If prompt contains ‘diabetes’ and ‘swelling’, fetch diabetic-foot guideline.”*  
  All routing logic lives in your backend.  
- In an **agentic** system, the **LLM itself** — running on **OpenAI’s API** or your **self-hosted model** (vLLM, Ollama, etc.) — decides which tool(s) to call.  
  Your backend only defines the toolbox and executes the tool the model requests.  

👉 The pipeline backend *makes the decisions*; the agentic backend *lets the LLM decide the actions.*

## 4️⃣ What do we need to build an AI system? 🏗️  

- **UI (Frontend)** → chat box or voice interface  
- **Backend Service** → orchestrates requests, routes to tools, ensures safety  
- **LLM** → reasoning engine (cloud or self-host)  
- **Vector DB (for RAG)** → Chroma, Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate  
- **Embeddings Service** → turns text into dense vectors (OpenAI, Hugging Face, local)  
- **Memory Store** → conversation context (Redis, DB)  
- **Tools (APIs/functions)** → custom endpoints for history, guidelines, labs, drug checks  
- **MCP Layer** → coordination, service discovery, compliance, guardrails  

---

## 5️⃣ Cloud vs Self-Host: Where Do Toolbox + LLM Live?  

- **(a) Cloud APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI)**  
  - Cloud LLM decides tool usage; backend executes implementation.  
  ✅ Simple, fast. ⚠️ PHI/PII exposure possible.  

- **(b) Host Your Own (Private API)**  
  - Deploy inside VPC/on-prem. Model decides locally.  
  ✅ Secure. ⚠️ Infra overhead — but commodity laptops can run smaller models (Mistral 7B, Phi-3).  

**Frameworks + Models:**  
- vLLM — (LLaMA 3, Mistral, Falcon, Mixtral, Gemma)  
- Ollama — (LLaMA 3, Mistral, Phi-3, Gemma)  
- Hugging Face TGI — (Falcon, Mistral, LLaMA 3)  
- LM Studio / LocalAI — desktop use (GGUF models)  
- Enterprise: Azure OpenAI (VNET), AWS Bedrock, NVIDIA Triton  

**Recommended Setup (Healthcare Hybrid):**  
- Cloud + privacy → Azure OpenAI (VNET) or AWS Bedrock  
- Strict on-prem → vLLM or TGI  
- Local pilot → Ollama or LM Studio  

👉 Backend code remains identical — only API endpoint changes.

## 6️⃣ Wrapping Up 🎯

Using the **diabetes + swelling** example, we’ve seen:

- **Pipelines:** predictable but rigid
- **Agentic AI:** flexible and scalable, needs a well-designed toolbox
- **Building blocks:** UI, backend orchestration, LLM, RAG, embeddings, memory, tools, MCP
- **Toolbox placement:** can integrate with cloud APIs or self-hosted LLMs
- **Models = brains; frameworks = nervous system**

**Takeaway:** You already know APIs and services — AI is just another service that’s probabilistic and needs guardrails.  
Start small:

1. Connect UI → LLM
2. Add RAG (vector DB)
3. Add memory
4. Add tools
5. Flip to agentic

Each step produces a working POC you can demo and extend.

💡 **Next Step in My Journey**  
I’m currently building this **prototype AI system** based on the architecture described here — complete with backend orchestration, RAG, memory, and agentic flows in C#.  
Once ready, I’ll publish the full project on **GitHub** so others can run it locally and extend it for their own use cases.
